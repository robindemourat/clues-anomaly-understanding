[Detecting underlying assumptions and expected practices in the Digital Humanities through the AIME project.](^^classed:baseline)

[Donato Ricci,](^^classed:author)[Robin de Mourat,](^^classed:author)[Christophe Leclercq,](^^classed:author)[Bruno Latour.](^^classed:author)

An Inquiry into Modes of Existence (AIME) is a huge, probably incomplete, experiment in both humanities and digital humanities (DH). Over a four year timespan, a vast and diversified *set-up* of technologies[#][ Here the term set-up refers to the network of complementary instances of the project. They are media components (print, web interfaces, meetings) supporting an ecosystem of practices distributed all along the nodes of the network.] has been conceived, developed, tested, and modified. Some of them clearly achieved the foreseen objectives, whereas others did not. For most of the set-up components, we struggled to design their features and to understand their agency. Although challenging from a management and scholarly point of view, this was not completely unexpected. AIME has provided the rare opportunity to craft all at once a new method of inquiry in philosophy, its own content, its format, and its way to disseminate its results, all the while striving to build an innovative relationship with a diversified spectrum of readers, thereby redefining the author-reader connection. In a more than chaotic trajectory, design practices played a major role, acting as critical and speculative agent:

> "Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry, experimentation, and expression, over usability, usefulness or desirability. A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future-oriented." (Lukens & DiSalvo 2011).

To make this projection towards the future relevant and to understand the role of AIME in the field of DH, as well as what has to be retained as good practice and what should be avoided in similar future projects, we propose a thoroughgoing observation. It is an empirical observation -to this extent we will try to adopt the same research posture as the AIME inquiry itself- based on the collection of different reactions collected with heterogeneous strategies: from digital methods of research to web analytics; from qualitative interviews to respondents to an online questionnaire. 

Johanna Drucker (2013) stated that finding a vocabulary -and we would also add finding the meaning (*what it is*) and the sense (*what it does*)- of a new technology (and here the new technology is the entire AIME set-up) takes time. During the initial development of AIME set-up, only a few components were presupposed and could be identified via a specific nomenclature. One of these was the principal investigator (PI): Bruno Latour. [In one of the first public presentations of AIME](^^modulo-href:Bruno Latour presents the project), delivered in late 2011, he defined it as a collective procedure triggered by a series of troublesome anthropological and philosophical questions. AIME’s ambition was to invent a medium for an empirical[#][ It is empirical in the sense that the demonstration and discussion of the philosophical arguments are grounded on anthropological experiences fostered by diverse types of documents (iconic, audio visual, textual… ).] inquiry concerned with ontological pluralism. The inquiry had started 25 years earlier as a personal endeavour[#][ For an historical account of the project see (Latour 2013).]. Given the huge scope and topic, it now had to be opened to other researchers willing to use the AIME protocol, method and style (borrowed from William James) in order to to validate and expand the results. 

^^modulo-aside:Bruno Latour presents the project

In this presentation, the moments of hesitation are clear, the moments when the names for designating technologies and procedure were trembling, signaling something still to invent. Leaving it to the philosophical community to judge the relevance and the quality of the arguments produced by AIME, in this paper we dedicate ourselves instead to describing the evolution of these hesitations. All the hesitations evolved into a chimera, one of the "strange beasts" described by Alessandro Ludovico (2012) whose component parts do not have a clear identity: thus, here was a collaborative inquiry presenting some results before the collaboration was even started; an academic book without footnotes and references; an open, on- and off-line platform to collaborate with peers in which subscription to a strict protocol was required. It is a composed set-up that we had to produce before being able to describe it[#][ Obviously this does not mean that we had no plan, no strategy. It's just that these were anticipated as achievements of the philosophy itself. This picture is among the very first comprehensive depictions of the project. http://bit.ly/1KCYN8l]. Eventually we produced what might called  **_{template-related expectations}_** where the produced artifacts didn’t present all of the features expected from the broader type of media they belonged to. The progressive  remediation of the original text implied new rules and incomplete materials.

# What AIME did: an anomalous hypothesis for Digital Humanities

^^modulo-aside:Counting AIME appelations

Observing how people described AIME is enlightening. By analysing 39 web pages retrieved by employing five  different search-engine queries and selected according to their relevance and pertinence[#][In December 2014 eight different search-engine queries have been designed to retieve all the pages mentioning the aime project and the different set-up components. The pages, then, have been qualitatively validated and the information about the project aspect manuelly estracted. For firther reference about this digital method strategy see (Rogers 2009). The full dataset is available here http://j.mp/DH-AIME-webpages.], almost [all the pages mentioned the book](^^modulo-href:Counting AIME appelations)[#][ On the basis of the aime set-up, the first community-oriented instance of the project is a printed artefact called “preliminar y report” in the project’s jargon, that one could also call a philosophical book. However, the latter appellation may be dangerously misleading, as this book does not present the expected conventional cognitive and cultural features one could expect from a contemporar y “philosophical book ”: it features neither footnotes or glossar y, nor any critical apparatus helping the reader to verif y the author’s statements even as it presents additional characteristics atypical of philosophical book templates, like expanded margins and a report-like index that provides the reader with a ver y precise overview of the contents. This first printed instance is therefore not an incomplete or defective version of a “philosophical book ”. This incompleteness is intentional; it is a call for reworking the project along with the other instantiations of the inquir y, and especially the digital interfaces of the project.] but only [few of them called it a report](^^modulo-href:The report): while it is easy to label a published academic artifact as a book, “the very best ‘interface’ ever designed” to convey arguments, it has been fairly impossible to reinforce its unstable nature by associating it with the word “report”. It is a kind of **_{mismatching of lexical references}_**, where the labels used for an established artifact didn’t fit with the “new” device’s experimentation.

Another interesting element of reflection emerged from the relatively small number  of pages mentioning AIME as an experiment in DH, even though, looking at twitter activity during the DH2014 meeting, Latour’s keynote speech received a great deal of attention.These initially high expectations were quickly frustrated by the clumsiness of the first version of the online platform and by the type of DH activities conducted on it. Aren’t these clues of a kind of **_{misaligned set-up practices}_** for DH, where data visualization and large datasets are supposed to be the "new" norm, whereas the reading of large numbers of documents is not?
Almost all the pages retrieved above mentioned the AIME collaborative aspects of the digital platform[#][The digital interfaces of the project find their unity in a shared url (modesofexistence.org). This accesses a blog-like home page, a first interface to the inquir y, named “ book entr y”, featuring the elements of the project in a layout composed of four columns: the first presents the preliminary report (txt), then comes a vocabulary discussion and definition column (voc), then contextual documents along with bibliographical references (doc), and last but not least collective contributions pointing at elements from the three previous columns (cont). The reader is then left free to navigate through a non-linear logic by clicking through the links bounding the diverse elements of the inquir y, reassembled through specific visual agencies depending on the main element read by the visitor. The second interface of the project, called “crossings entr y”, displays the elements of the inquir y as sorted through the theoretical framework of the moe argument, which are modes and their crossings. It allows to build alternative and non exclusive pathways, called scenarios, into the elements of the inquir y (book paragraphs, vocabular y entr y, documents), each of which is intended to shed new light on the meaning of modes and their crossings.] but only a few cited the [face-to face meetings](^^modulo-href:The meetings)[#][ Another instantiation of the project consisted of physical meetings gathering various people interested in specific modes and responding to a call for contributions on the digital version of the inquiry.] that had been [widely communicated](^^modulo-href:AIME on Twitter). This is in marked contrast to the other digital methods analysis that we conducted using twitter[#][All the twitts extracted as mentioned before have been processed to extract their dates and the eventual mentioned hashtags and users. For further information about this digital methods strategy see (Marres and Weltevrede 2013) The full dataset is available here: http://j.mp/DH-AIME-twitts]. [Having a look at the graph produced by connecting hashtags and users certainly gives the impression of a complete contrast](^^modulo-href:Graph of correlations between hashtags and users around AIME).

^^modulo-aside:Graph of correlations between hashtags and users around AIME

Evident at first glance is [a polarization between AIME and its PI](^^modulo-href:Polarization clues through Twitter). It is probably a reflection of a **_{personality and status refraction}_** where the reputation/perception of a specific project actor multiplies multiplies engagements with the project itself. [If we remove the two main nodes a clearer view of the discussion around AIME arises](^^modulo-href:AIME on twitter - without its main actors). Some discussions are shown to be revolving around DH memes (eg. #digitalhumanities) and are clustered around the various AIME workshops and side events (eg. #thatcamplyon). As would be expected, discussions appear around the usual fields of study with which the PI is associated (#sociology, #ANT, #sts) as well as other projects conducted by him (#mooc, #cop21). Here we can see a sort of **_{amalgamation of heterogeneous public}_**, where the composition and scale of the communities being formed do not fit with with what had been expected. The projected audience did not conform to a single discipline/ community, which engendered some confusion, thereby [leading to misunderstandings](^^modulo-href:Misunderstandings on Twitter).

This is just a shallow *understanding* of what the AIME project did, trying to recombine new techniques and usual intellectual technologies.  [With different timing in each case](^^modulo-href:AIME-related hashtags over time), the project created different expectations from various communities -philosophers, designers, DH researchers-, as well as a wide range of frustrations and protestations. We are proposing to reframe these different elements as *clues* allowing us to detect different *analogous* practices and representations at work in philosophy, collaboration-based projects, design and DH communities.

This paper will: 

* detail the methodical activity of collecting different criticisms, considered as clues for detecting anomalies (signaled by **_{anomaly}_**) and grouping them into 3 families[#][ A further family has been identified as well. We have temporarily dubbed it “Developing through publishing” and refer to the peculiar process of developing a project while having already constituted an audience around its first instance, and to the role of different team members in such an endeavour. Since it is still under elaboration we prefer not to publish it here but to add it to a future article.], such as to show how AIME diverges from the established and analogous practices of (digital) humanities;
* look for a cause for these anomalies by eliciting the choices which eventually generated them;
* evaluate each anomaly as: a) future norms (innovations), b) useful mistakes for similar experiments in the future, c) non-fixable anomalies, which reveal underlying assumptions in the audience and participants.

While its assessment on the basis of users’ requirements and feedback[#][ Gibbs, F., & Owens, T. (2012). Building Better Digital Humanities Tools: Toward broader audiences and user-centered designs, 6(2). Retrieved from http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000136/000136.html], although difficult to be conducted in DH[#][ Kemman, M., & Kleppe, M. (n.d.). Too Many Varied User Requirements for Digital Humanities Projects. Retrieved from http://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/cac2014_submission_29_0.pdf], could have been possible, more interesting is observing to what extent the "digital" aspect of the project has been embedded into the research. In a situation where the DH is still delineating its position, shape and role in a wider academic environment, our way to study the AIME project -focussing on what has done more than on what it is- will help to produce a wider understanding of some assumptions and expectations about DH itself.

The DH field is increasingly heading to a certain stabilization of formats, methods and goals[#][ Although with a not strictly rigid normative sense it could be cited as a clue towards this need of standardization noted in this passagefrom the book Digital_Humanities (Lunenfeld et al. 2012): “The capacity for the rapid creation, testing, and reworking of Digital Humanities projects goes hand-in-hand with the f lexibility, mutability, and extensibility of digital media. But with the development of more Digital Humanities projects comes a new, normative center in which tool sets are stabilizing. Curation, collection, and data management are cohering around shared standards, while concrete rationales for the production and deployment of Digital Humanities methodologies have emerged in the academy.” ], supported by the installation of shared infrastructures[#][ See, for instance, the DARIAH European infrastructure : https://www.dariah.eu/ and the Research Infrastructures in the Digital Humanities from ERS http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/Public_documents/Publications/spb42_RI_DigitalHumanities.pdf]. This tendency towards a "conventionalization" is motivated by the need for technical interoperability (e.g. text encoding initiatives (Renear 2008)) and methodological comparativity of research programs and projects. It is also driven by empirical, trial-and-error procedures towards new research methods: a lot of projects are trying to establish a more stable basis stemming from previous experiments and for further projects. This approach could be described as a *conventional* - we would rather say an *analogous -* way of solving problems which is opposed to a *design* mode grounded on our ability to “imagine something that is not there” (Manzini 2015). Acting in this mode, the highly idiosyncratic activity of AIME could be a useful trigger to observe which are the *conventions* populating, in terms of practices as much as values, the communities of digital humanities. Our investigation could then inform us about how much the AIME project has been an *anomaly* to these emerging and various conventions. Anomaly here is not opposed to normativity (*nomos)* but to regularity (*omalos)*(Canguilhem 1991). The notion is flexible enough to compare the project with its hosting environments avoiding too sharply-edged distinctions (normative vs exceptional) and respecting the highly empirical statements of digital humanists while questioning them.

To perform this anomaly-detection activity, we could draw our methodological framework from an ancient dispute about the nature and evolution of language (Douay and Pinto 1991). This opposed, during the 2nd century B.C., the stoics of Pergamon (the anomalist school) and the philologists of Alexandria (the analogist school). While *analogists* were looking for proportional repetitions to be instituted into grammatical rules, *anomalists* were looking for exceptions that would bring these rules into question. The situation ended up with a very fruitful debate where at stake was as much the description of language as the ethical rules for its further development. In other words, the question was whether to assess language in terms of conventional rules or relevance inside a specific context. We argue here that both approaches are complementary in order to understand the activity patterns of an object of study such as Digital Humanities. However, as analogies rarely provoke reactions and are thus difficult to trace, focusing our attention on which DH *anomalies* the AIME project has produced would allow for a richer and softer interpretation of DH's implicit and explicit emerging regulatory principles. What is at stake here is the evaluation of the process of building and practicing material set-ups which is central to the DH building-based hermeneutics (Ramsay 2011). Trying to grasp the intrinsic intellectual value of the *making* and use of DH artifacts is a complex task. It requires us to question their very relation to the theoretical humanities endeavour they "serve" and interact with (Ramsay & Rockwell 2012).

# Setting up listening devices

^^modulo-aside:The timespan of collect

[In order to detect AIME's anomalies, we designed a serie of listening devices, both inquiry methods and visual instruments, which enabled us to grasp reactions and practices produced by the project. They were purposed for both design research and for more pragmatical project management reasons, harvesting data from October 2013 to April 2015](^^modulo-href:The timespan of collect). These devices are:

* a systematic analysis of the project's mentions over the web
* a twitter activity analysis over AIME-related twitter activity[#][Everything written by, addressed to or containing: @aimeproject, modesofexistence, modes _of_existence, “Bruno Latour”, brunolatour, modesofexistence | modes_of_existence | #brunolatour | aimeproject, aimeproject.org]
* a questionnaire analysis, based on a study concerning 220 of the 6000 registered users of project's platform
* a platform's database analysis featuring recordings about enlisted co-inquirers and their writing activities
* an analysis of google analytics data about the digital platform
* a series of interviews with team members conducted during the more active phase of the project by an external researcher

The above-mentioned devices allow us to make use of both quantitative and qualitative, enunciative and practical, insiders’ and outsiders’ data. We analyzed each of these sources considering all the traces collected after the passage of the project as clues requiring an inferential explanation.[#][This activity is largely inspired by the indiciary paradigm of Ginzburg (1980).]

^^modulo-aside:Well-aligned depictions

Since its objective was to test the same theoretical hypothesis within diverse media and towards diverse audiences, AIME has been conceived to support a series of complementary -on- and off-line, textual and visual, specific and generic media- scholarly practices. Looking at the project reviews and external online reports, [some reactions were "well-aligned" in their understanding](^^modulo-href:Well-aligned depictions) of this *multimodal*[#][As McPherson stated (2008), a multimodal scholar should make profit of a variegated array of literacy forms. She goes further posing a question that was at the very core of AIME: “How do you ‘experience’ or ‘ feel ’ an argument in a more immersive and sensor y-rich space?”] strategy. However, others revealed that this distributed media organization ended up with some **_{missing connections}_** between the components of the project. Some descriptions simply did not take into account one or several of the project's instances -pointing out some lacks of consistency or solidity-, while other ones reproached to one element not to propose the functionalities it was aimed at, that, indeed, were fulfilled by another one-. The printed instance was blamed for not providing  contextual references - they were available in the 'book entry' of the digital platform-; the 'book entry' of the platform was accused of not allowing enough discussion and debate -that were designed to be held during physical events-; and so on. What had been conceived as a distributed environment of complementary workplaces, was received in these cases as an hegemonic factory for digital intellectual labour[#][This latter feeling could also have been favoured by the technical problems initially faced by the site, which made it sometimes slow and irritating, due to its experimental and evaluative history. The lack of seamlessness may have engendered some doubts about the relevance of such an ecosystem of instances: “In any case, it is faster and easier to negotiate the book via a pdf file than through the web interface, or certainly it is better to keep ready to hand the pdf or the paper copy when waiting for the website to slowly grind back into life.” (Berry 2014)].

^^modulo-aside:Comparisons to wikipedia - an example

Another source of displacement in the understanding of the project came from **_{template-related expectations}_** and the -deceptive although natural- [comparisons they made explicitly or implicitly between AIME specific artifacts and more widespread new media templates](^^modulo-href:AIME - related wordings)[#][ 6 Namely: social media platforms, blogging platforms, wiki websites, academic documents online repositories and digital archives.] with which they shared some features or methodological resonances. Indeed, while the printed artifact has been criticised for being flawed as an defective version of a "philosophical book" due to its lack of critical apparatus, more subtle analogies were made regarding the digital instances. 
The principle of a collective endeavour supported by digital means and framed through systematic guidelines often caused the project to be likened to an encyclopedia[#][  This distinction has been underlined several times and in different writing, for further discussion see (Ricci, De Mourat, and Boulanger 2014; Ricci and De Mourat 2015; Ricci 2013). ]. Features such as the extended glossary (VOC column of the 'book entry'), is extremely systematic organization, the organization of project content as a network of linked entries, and the ability to search, may have strengthened such a comparison. They ended up in recurrent doleances about the absence of some topics judged as mandatory in the AIME database (e.g. [feminist history](^^modulo-href:Reflections about the absence of feminism), [petro-chemicals](^^modulo-href:Reflections about the absence of petro-chemicals), etc.) or more broadly criticized as an hegemonic approach to modernity vocabulary, contradictory to the scope of the project. 
[We also noticed the project being compared to the archetype of Wikipedia](^^modulo-href:Comparisons to wikipedia - an example) and its corresponding principles of organization. Wikipedia's approaches to *crowdsourcing*, *source citing*, or *content mutability*, were unthinkingly applied to the project, and seem to have produced misaligned requirements about its content management policy and collective organization[#][ See also anomaly family #3.].

[Another recurrent comparison was with blogs](^^modulo-href:Comparison with blogs), from the PI’s argument about blogs being the opposite to project’s principles of collaboration to [external critiques emphasizing the similarities between the two forms](^^modulo-href:Similarities with a blog) -and thus the lack of "originality" of the set-up, contra to its claims of exceptionality. Comparison with blogs allowed the project to be evaluated in terms of innovation and its distance to this *conventional* point of reference. It also imported false expectations regarding easiness to comment upon and discuss user contributions.
One last observation regarding the question of templates is related to the scarce reference to scholarly journals, monographs or other academic templates when relating to the project.

We could try to explain the **_{missed connections}_** provoked by the project as a clash between the tradition of the humanities to use (one) text as the main (and only) media for intellectual argument, while here the expectation was for multimodal shifts and specifically designed interfaces. But if we then try to understand them in the specific context of DH experiments, some **_{media-related expectations}_** may also have been caused by the set-up heterogeneity in terms of templates compliance or divergence: on the one hand various generic media and tools used for the project life (twitter, AIME blog, mailing list, Google Drive meeting materials), and on the other hand the parts which were specifically designed for the inquiry. The latter presented a strong visual and organizational homogeneity (e.g. book and interfaces were presented with the same typesetting and colors, dialoguing with similar visual codes). It could be stated, firstly, that their peculiarity asked for some linking with existing templates, provoking the displacements that we have described. Secondly, that the specifically new artifacts were perceived as designed to fulfil every cognitive and intellectual requirement of such a project while some of them, like project discussion and scholarly debate, could (and have) also have been fulfilled by more generic media such as twitter or [blogs](^^modulo-href:External blogs).

^^modulo-aside:Tutorial of the book entry

Once the different reactions provoked by the AIME were observed and analyzed, we could focus on the very activity of people engaged with it. The possibility of contributing to the inquiry was meant to be open to diverse practitioners and scholars able to witness the clash between the "modes of existence". This process required an **_{evolving set of skills}_**: the co-inquirers should have known the main inquiry narrative by having reading the report, then navigated through the extended contextual contents on the "book entry". They could bookmark some pieces through a specific functionality. Eventually they were encouraged to contribute by attaching to one part of existing content a production of their own in order to amend/expand the original PI work. 
In this process a huge role role was played by the face-to-face meetings. [Comparing the platform overall reading activity and the project events agenda](^^modulo-href:Project event agenda and website consultation), it seems quite clear that the digital platform activity was correlated with the AIME workshops and events agenda. 
[Comparing the events agenda with the rhythm of contributions on the platform, a similar correlation can be observed](^^modulo-href:Events and contributions). 
[Looking, then, at project reading metrics in more detail, it can be seen how the "contributions column" was more and more consulted as more and more workshops were offered](^^modulo-href:Reading the four columns of the book entry). These correlations show that the co-inquirers subscribed rather well to the proposed sequence of activities. Accordingly, when looking at the questionnaire sent to platform subscribers it can be seen that [people participating in workshops were more likely to be published and to write contributions](^^modulo-href:Workshops and contributions). Furthermore, most of those who declared having actually read the report, owned and used a hard-copy of the inquiry and also read the document of the project (VOC and DOC). These findings are a good indication of the AIME multimodal plan of action. It seems that this multimodal awareness was the main condition for having people successfully engaged in the project methodology.

^^modulo-aside:Reading the four columns of the book entry

The **_{unusual blend of practices}_**required by the project online contribution scenario asked that participants pass through a series of particular steps designed to make their intervention become an empirical contribution. To do so -following the suggestion to react to specific parts of the text, rather than addressing general remarks- they were firstly supposed to select an anchor point, being a report or vocabulary word or paragraph, and then attach to it a "contribution"[#][ In order to emphasize the role of empiricism and evidence according to the project's mindest, the "contribution" entity was a composite and constrained format composed of a short abstract and a series of slides presenting commented documents.]. It is clear that a first condition for being able to contribute was to know how to navigate and get acquainted with the contents available on the web. [Users with the highest digital literacy level were able to profit of the writing and bookmarking functionalities](^^modulo-href:Digital literacy and website functionnalities). If we look more deeply into the platform database of co-inquirer activity[#][Collecting personal anonymized information declared at sign-up, and information related to bookmarking and annotation/contribution activity.], [it can be clearly seen that these diverse demanding practices were deployed by a rather small part of the community](^^modulo-href:A few digitally committed co-inquirers). Furthermore, one sees a correlation between the community of contributors and the community of "bookmarkers", which means that people who had discovered/used one of the website's features were more likely to enter the complete scenario of use that was proposed to them. Digital literacy (Gilster 1998) proved as well to be an important factor for subscribing to the methodological affordances of the project interface. An insightful clue to the digital literacy required by the project is the observation that [none of the respondents declaring to have a low or very low level in this skill wrote a contribution](^^modulo-href:Digital literacy and contributions). Similarly, we can observe that people declaring a higher level were more likely to be published on the platform at some point. Therefore, looking at this questionnaire, it seems that the overall project set-up was well-fitted for a really specific category of users, those who presented both content and research-related skills and familiarity with digital environment. Having a look at the qualitative feedback from the person in charge of managing contributors, some explanations can be found. Besides [the difficulty of finding, understanding and using such features](^^modulo-href:Difficulties for contributing)[#][ It has to be said that the UI/UX elements for performing this actions is pretty similar to the ones present in the vast majority of reading/annotation softwares and annotations.], a [strong intellectual compliance to contribution content organization (an abstract, followed by a series of documents) was required](^^modulo-href:Formatting and engaging).

^^modulo-aside:Digital literacy and contributions

Another explanation could rely on the ways of presenting the project features to the reader. While the website was designed to focus attention and help navigating inside a dense network of neatly packed content, it produced at the same time [a certain intimidation for the potential contributors](^^modulo-href:Platform intimidation). The design of *rhetorical expression* (Buchanan 1985) developed in the AIME platform granted access to a huge amount of very sophisticated content, and simultaneously asked for contribution to and expansion of that content. While multimodal inquiry and composition seem to be one of the most promising aspects of DH experiments, we have experienced how such an endeavour needed to take into account scholars’ various digital literacies, and sometimes collided with them: encouraging a specific mindset through very specific interfaces requires a long learning curve and inevitably excludes some users. However, mixing of digital activities with other types of undertaking helps to strengthen on-screen practices and seems to participate to the development of a *multilayered literacy* (Selfe 1988).

^^modulo-aside:Divergent interests

During a French digital humanities event the collective and collaborative nature of the AIME project was challenged as presenting a certain non-reciprocity between the main authors and contributors: co-inquirers were asked to dedicate a huge amount of time while not clearly enough being acknowledged as genuine contributors to the inquiry. During the meeting, the very principle of contribution was under discussion as a matter of intellectual work reward.

If we compare the project idea of a contribution to that of the *analogical* academic publishing habitus, the AIME contribution activity is indeed somehow perturbing: it could be framed on the one hand as an open reviewing process -where co-inquirers propose modifications and improvements- and on the other hand as a journal call for contributions, through which accepted submitters get to the status of author. It has to be said that [the PI considered contributors to have specific and autonomous interests in the project and a shared -though limited- status of author](^^modulo-href:Divergent interests). Although limited, the [acknowledgement of the co-inquirers' authorship](^^modulo-href:Negotiating the recognition of the contributors) has been done by [featuring them on platform credits](^^modulo-href:Contributors on the platform). The very format of the contributions, a sort of **_{middle-state publishing}_**[#][ Wilcox, S. (2013, June 12). Feed-forward scholarship: Why games studies needs middle-state publishing. First Person Scholar. Retrieved from http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/feed-forward-scholarship/] between traditional academic contribution and academic blogpost argumentation[#][ See for instance the scientific blogging platform hypotheses: http://hypotheses.org], coupled with an **_{ambivalent status identification}_**, may have caused this difficulty.

The contribution validation process itself has been under discussion. The contributions followed a definite [process of mediation and review](^^modulo-href:The contribution process) as a result of their compliance with a specific research methodology, strategy and empirical protocol. They were evaluated and followed by a small collective of scholars  acquainted with certain intellectual regions of the inquiry: [these particular reviewers were labeled as mediators](^^modulo-href:The mediators - a peculiar role). This distribution provoked some critique. Some co-inquirers criticized the lack of transparency of the process[#][ The AIME team published 2 'AIME leaks' to inform user about the revision process. For instance, see at http://www.modesofexistence.org/answer-to-a-reader-reponse-a-un-lecteur/ the disclosure of a non-published contribution and its justification; and at http://www.modesofexistence.org/contribution-recognizing-the-risk-how-to-navigate-between-att-and-hab a successful contribution email exchanges.] [and questioned the "testability" of AIME methodology as a closed process](^^modulo-href:Evaluing AIME). Here we face an intellectual critique highlighting an **_{ethical disjunction}_**** **between design project choices and some [philosophers advocating for alternative ways of doing philosophy](^^modulo-href:Q&A about the contribution process). 


^^modulo-aside:Translating bookish focus

Other similar **_{ethical disjunction}_** can be seen through the reactions to [some public presentations of the project to DH audiences](^^modulo-href:Closeness and the digital humanities), presenting *closeness* as one of the core values of the project. Closeness was presented as *distance*: a close arguments analysis also required a *close reading* activity rather than a *distant* one (Moretti 2013). [Closeness was also presented as *focus*: producing philosophical argument required a non-distracting environment](^^modulo-href:Translating bookish focus)[#][ This concern has been expressed through design choices such as not pointing to external websites inside the digital instances of the project while allowing the embedding inside this protected workplace of a variety of media and contents coming from external sources.]. This declaration provoked strong reactions inside DH communities since openness[#][ “The digital is the realm of the: open source, open resources. Anything that attempts to close this space should be recognized for what it is: the enemy.” (Presner, Schnapp, and Lunenfeld 2009).] is one of the key values allowing humanities to address contemporary issues and reframe their role inside society (Spiro 2012).
Although the gap between the ethos of collaboration and closeness claims could be minimized by the fact that the whole inquiry content is freely available to anyone, and that its generated contents (not being formerly copyrighted) are published under Creative Commons license[#][The websites were nevertheless password protected because of legal reasons concerning quoted documents such as texts and videos, and the source code of digital interfaces was not published at first because it was not reusable as is. At the moment of this writing, interfaces are in the process of being open sourced.], the question of controlling the process of collaboration remains under question. [While the team members interviewed unanimously valued the opening of access as mandatory, some others also argued for the need of a protection to maintain homogeneity and coherence within inquiry](^^modulo-href:Team views on openness and closeness). Underneath the values statements discussion laid also a practical tension between the need for methodological quality and the broader political wishes and projects about the scholarly community formation in a digital age. 

From an ethical point of view, we have seen that the complex process of constituting a collective body of inquiry provoked important reactions among its publics, responses motivated by several cultural references and agendas (advocates of an alternative academy, of open access, of open software…). We see through this anomaly how DH projects may gather under the same roof a broad variety of ethical guidelines and value systems. While openness seems to be a shared value of digital humanists, it seems to us that the expression of such a notion would need somehow to be precisely cast regarding the several underlying meanings it is given (Tkacz 2015), and modeled according to the specific needs and methodological goals of one’s project.

# Qualifying anomalies for better (understanding of) digital humanities projects


By collecting clues and spotting anomalies our AIME critical review helped us to get a better understanding of the reaction coming from different communities of users. In this last part we will focus on operationalising these anomalies to debrief and assess the AIME project itself. Hopefully, transforming the anomalies into recommendations, warnings or observational remarks will inform future projects. 

Some anomalies we detected could be seen as *future* *analogies* and *future* *conventions*, becoming a base for *future norms* if they reached a certain level of dissemination[#][ We would here follow Canguilhem's definition of anomaly regarding biologic life, as a successful mutation that "spreads into space rather than time" and is sometimes eventually recast as a normativity producer. Here the distinction established by Canguilhem with illness seems highlighting: "Another reason for avoiding confusion between anomaly and disease is that human attention is not sensitized to each as being divergences of the same kind. An anomaly manifests itself in spatial multiplicity, disease, in chronological succession. It is a characteristic of disease that it interrupts a course; in fact it is critical." Canguilhem, Georges. op. cit., 1991 edition, p. 138]. Anomalies like **_{missed connections}_** could be attenuated by the proliferation of multimodal and distributed projects, and the **_{peculiar formatting of practices}_** which were proposed might be more readily accepted after a longer period of use.

It is inevitable to consider some anomalies as mistakes or even illness, being transgressions of justified norms. These are not able (and for our case, not wished) to come back into any normative status. Such anomalies as **_{template-related expectations}_** and **_{ambivalent status identifications}_** could have been handled in a clearer way[#][ We could have for instance tried to feature inquiry's contents through a wider range of points of view, acknowledging the work of particular contributors. We could as well have put a priority on providing co-inquirers with a way to reference their work and embed it on other places on the web.]. The understanding of their genesis will inform other projects that would want to walk down similar paths.

Some other anomalies could be qualified as specific, undecidable features. These cannot be cast into the former categories or linked to any guidelines or recommendations, either because they constitute purely phenomenological (observation-based) anomalies or are completely idiosyncratic to the project. They present some features of the project as aspects that will be seen "this way or that way" by one or another community without any possibility of deciding how to cast them. For example, the **_{ethical disjunctions}_** provoked by the project remain still to be discussed, as the **_{matching skills and affordances}_** issue remains attached to a peculiar methodological wager of the project. These are therefore anomalies of epistemological interest, informing "the ways" digital humanities publics expect and preconceive the artifacts they are dealing with.

In the introduction of his book David M. Berry (2012) framed DH latest developments as anomaly-producing agents that allow us to question and challenge the traditional values, expectations and methodologies of the humanities[#][*Indeed, we could say that third-wave digital humanities points the way in which digital technology highlights the anomalies generated in a humanities research project and which leads to a questioning of the assumptions implicit in such research, e.g. close reading, canon formation, periodization, liberal humanism, etc.* Introduction, in (Berry 2012)]. Although this assertion is probably crucial for framing DH inside the broader humanities, we could also admit that DH are themselves in a process of normalization or "conventionalization", following necessarily the installation of shared standards and infrastructures, but also values and practices based on the feedback given from the first experiments in the field.
In that sense, DH could be addressed as an anomaly themselves, as the temporary and preliminary sign of an imminent change of paradigm within the humanities. However, we argue that this conception is a perilous move, because it would wipe out the privileged capacity of DH to continuously interrogate, through an experimentation dealing with technical, social and experiential *means*, the very *ends* and groundings on the basis of which research is conducted. As stated by (Lunenfeld et al. 2012):

> When new norms establish themselves, when new procedures and techniques become naturalized, assumptions can become invisible. […] the new routines that structure this world of practice have the potential to become just as sedimented and automatic as those of the print era, and when they do, they sound the death knell for Digital Humanities as a practice that is both critical and experimental.

The anomaly-tracking hypothesis seems to be a good antidote to this risk. Anomalous dimensions of DH experiments are essential features for its critical approach to the contemporary condition of humanistic knowledge. We advocate that they should not be left out for the future developments of the field, but rather deliberately produced and then observed for their reflective qualities. Drawing back to the antique grammarian quarrel at the core of this paper’s methodological framework, we would like to recommend a little more stoican and a little less aristotelian digital humanities, thereby acknowledging that the nature of DH lies less in essential regulating principles than in a corpus of irregularities, tropes or spontaneous moves that give its reflective and transgressive value to Digital Humanities practice.

I fully expected the argument to be debated in the normal ways that is through old fashion reviews, new blog like sites, reading groups, pep talks and gossips. Philosophical discussions should proceed according to their normal ways. Whenever I can, I will answer, but it is not our primary goal. Let thousand flowers flourish. I don’t think we need any special device for that. We are all good at it."
