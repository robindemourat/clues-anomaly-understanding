# Abstract

Imagine a collective inquiry presenting its results before the collaboration has even started; an academic book without footnotes and references; an open, on-and-off-line platform to collaborate with peers where all must subscribe to a strict protocol to express their ideas. This is the AIME (An Inquiry into Modes of Existence) project. It is an experimental intertwining of analog and digital practices often contradicting the norms and formats they belonged to, thus creating expectations and protestations from different communities of users. Adopting a critical position toward the project, we multiplied the listening devices to collect these accusations. We propose, here, to reframe them as ***clues*** to detect the different practices and assumptions at work in collaboration-based projects, design, and Digital Humanities communities. This paper details the methodical activity of collecting clues, grouping them in specific ***anomalies***, then explicating the choices that generated them. In a situation where Digital Humanities are still delineating their position and role in the wider academic environment, our way to study the AIME project will help reframe the role of experiments in the Digital Humanities. This study about AIME enables an ***understanding*** of some underlying assumptions and expectations in Digital Humanities.

Keywords: anomalies, close reading, collaborative frameworks, critical and speculative design, digital humanities

# Introduction

An Inquiry into Modes of Existence (AIME) project tried to explore the many discrepancies between the description that the Moderns are offering of their values and the ways they are defended in practice. For instance, there is a huge gap between Science capital S and the scientific institutions. There is almost no relationship between Technology as it is hyped and the ways technical artifacts are actually produced. This gap also exists in law, politics, religion, etc. Such discrepancies raise the question of deciding which version of their values the Moderns are ready to defend: the official one or the more practical ones? In order to pursue such a vast inquiry, we needed to transform the inquiry of a lone ethnographer into a collective undertaking of a community of co-inquirers. In order to achieve this transformation, in addition to the publication of a book, we produced a series of workshops and meetings and the design of a digital platform with the intention of testing and expanding the preliminary results of the inquiry.

This is where AIME project overlaps with innovative practices in Digital Humanities (DH). This meant we had to build, technologically speaking, an on-the-fly experiment that depended as much on the scholarly practices of philosophy and anthropology as on the many new skills and habits of the emerging DH field. Over a four-year timespan, a vast and diversified set-up of technologies 1 has been designed, developed, tested, and modified. Some of them clearly achieved the foreseen objectives, whereas others did not. For most of them, we struggled to design their features and to understand their agency. Although challenging from a management and scholarly point of view, this was not completely unexpected. AIME has provided the rare opportunity to craft all at once a new method of inquiry in philosophy, its own content, its format, and a way to disseminate its results, all the while striving to build an innovative relationship with a diversified spectrum of readers. In a more than chaotic trajectory, design practices played a major role, acting as critical and speculative agents. To understand the role of AIME in the field of DH, as well as what has to be retained as good practices and what should be avoided in similar future projects, we offer here a thoroughgoing analysis. It is an empirical observation — to this extent we will try to adopt the same research posture as the AIME inquiry itself — based on the gathering of different feedback collected with heterogeneous strategies: from digital methods of research to web analytics; from qualitative interviews to an
online questionnaire.

# AIME and its Digital Humanities set-up

Johanna Drucker (2013) stated that finding a vocabulary — and we would also add
finding the meaning (*what it is*) and the sense (*what it does*) — of a new technology (and here the new technology is the entire AIME set-up) takes time. During the initial


# About the authors

[Donato Ricci,](^^classed:authorinline) is design lead and Post-Doc researcher at médialab | SciencesPo.
He conducts research concerning the role of design practices in human and social sciences. He followed all the design aspects of the AIME project. Furthermore, he is involved in projects using visual models, tools, and approaches for observing social phenomena through digital traces. Since 2005, he has been part of the development of the DensityDesign Lab where he deepened his interest in exploring the role of visual languages to foster public engagement in complex social issues. He is Assistant Professor of Representação e Conhecimento at Universidade de Aveiro and teaches Data & Information Visualization at Parsons Paris.

[Robin de Mourat](^^classed:authorinline) is Ph.D. student in Aesthetics & Digital Humanities at Université Rennes 2 (France), under the direction of Nicolas Thély. He is also involved as a designer in various experiments exploring the intersection between humanities practices and digital tools design. His Ph.D. research aims at exploring the contemporary forms of design practice in academic publishing. Inside this frame, he has conducted a one year-long field study about the AIME project.

[Christophe Leclercq](^^classed:authorinline) is an art historian, teacher, and project manager working at Sciences Po and The Ecole du Louvre, Paris. His research is based on the relationship between art and technology, and on digital archives in art history (the E.A.T. Datascape). He has collaborated with many engineers, artists and designers toward the development of experimental projects in art, and the promotion and diffusion of their research via exhibitions, workshops, lectures, and conferences. He has acted as project manager of the ‘médialab’ and AIME Project (‘An Inquiry into Modes ofExistence’), led by Bruno Latour.

[Bruno Latour](^^classed:authorinline) is Professor at Sciences Po Paris and head of its médialab,specializing in digital methods and digital humanities, and has recently published An inquiry Into Modes of Existence (Harvard UP 2013) whose content is replicated in a digital platform accessible on modesofexistence.org. All the references to his work and most of his papers are accessible on bruno-latour.fr
