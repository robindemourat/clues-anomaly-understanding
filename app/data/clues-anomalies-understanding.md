[Donato Ricci,](^^classed:authorinline) is design lead and Post-Doc researcher at médialab | SciencesPo.
He conducts research concerning the role of design practices in human and social sciences. He followed all the design aspects of the AIME project. Furthermore, he is involved in projects using visual models, tools, and approaches for observing social phenomena through digital traces. Since 2005, he has been part of the development of the DensityDesign Lab where he deepened his interest in exploring the role of visual languages to foster public engagement in complex social issues.

[Robin de Mourat](^^classed:authorinline) is Ph.D. student in Aesthetics & Digital Humanities at Université Rennes 2 (France), under the direction of Nicolas Thély. He is also involved as a designer in various experiments exploring the intersection between humanities practices and digital tools design. His Ph.D. research aims at exploring the contemporary forms of design practice in academic publishing. Inside this frame, he has conducted a one year-long field study about the AIME project.

[Christophe Leclercq](^^classed:authorinline) is an art historian, teacher, and project manager working at Sciences Po and The Ecole du Louvre, Paris. His research is based on the relationship between art and technology, and on digital archives in art history (the E.A.T. Datascape). He has collaborated with many engineers, artists and designers toward the development of experimental projects in art, and the promotion and diffusion of their research via exhibitions, workshops, lectures, and conferences. He has acted as project manager of the ‘médialab’ and AIME Project (‘An Inquiry into Modes ofExistence’), led by Bruno Latour.

[Bruno Latour](^^classed:authorinline) is Professor at Sciences Po Paris and head of its médialab,specializing in digital methods and digital humanities, and has recently published An inquiry Into Modes of Existence (Harvard UP 2013) whose content is replicated in a digital platform accessible on modesofexistence.org.
