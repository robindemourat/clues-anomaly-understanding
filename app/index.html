<meta name="DCTERMS.Abstract" content="Imagine a shared inquiry presenting its results before the collaboration has even started; an academic book without footnotes and references; an open, on and off-line, platform to collaborate with peers where you must subscribe to a strict protocol to express your ideas. This is the aime (An Inquiry into Modes of Existence) project, a chimera, an experimental intertwining of analog and digital objects which often contradicted the diverse norms and formats they belonged to.

Aime tried to substitute and recombine new techniques with usual intellectual technologies, creating different interests and expectations from different communities: philosophers, designers, Digital Humanities researchers, etc. Along with this result, a wide range of frustrations and protestations emerged, unveiling the different communities’ expectations, habits and values.

Adopting a critical position toward our own creature, we multiplied our listening devices to collect the accusations that the various aime communities were emitting: tweets, e-mails, interviews, users activity-logs and reappropriation of the project. We propose to reframe these different accusations as clues allowing us to detect different analogous practices and representations at work in philosophy, collaboration-based projects, design and digital humanities communities.

After expounding the experience of translating the aime idea of the project in different environments, this paper will detail the methodical activity of collecting the more or less explicit clues about the project’s diverse feedbacks, grouping them in specific anomalies, then justify the nature of the technical and intellectual choices that generated them.

In a situation where the Digital Humanities are still delineating their position, shape and role in the wider academic environment, our way to study the aime project will help reframe and enrich the role of experiments in the digital humanities. Conceived (and equipped) as an anomaly-making practice, the aime experiment enabled a wider understanding of some underlying assumptions and expectations about Digital Humanities.">
