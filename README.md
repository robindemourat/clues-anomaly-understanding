Modulo - *make a multimodal academic publication from a simple text file*
==========

Modulo is a rendering engine for multimodal publishing projects - built with flexibility, extensibility and lightness as core values.

The goal is to allow for quickly setting up a scholarly textual document accompanied with various interactive/multimodal contents.

To do so, the tool reads as input a simple text file (in markdown) and serves as output a browsable, printable, indexing-friendly document.

Modulo uses the flexibility of markdown to develop an extensible description language that can be adapted to different kinds of interactive publishing needs - or even extended by programming-skilled scholars.

And ... no db, no backend !

If you plan to use it, remember that this is still :

# WIP // WIP // WIP // WIP

Work in progress, bugs in quantity, use it at your own risks !
